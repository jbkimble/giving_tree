## Giving Tree
Giving tree is an application which allows hospitals and long term care facilities to track the unique needs of individual patients and monitor their care and recovery.  
Problem: 
Patients can have numerous medical requirments, dietary restrictions, and specialized needs that are difficult for a rotating 
staff to monitor and ensure the patients needs are being met.  
Solution:
Giving Tree is patient oriented care software, built with the goal of fundamentally impacting patients outcomes by facilitating healing and world class care through a structured easy and enjoyable to use user interface.
